    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <h4>Mr. Craig Kneale</h4>
    <p>
      Having worked for a local shipping agency in Bunbury for nearly 20 years, Craig moved to Geraldton 19 years ago to head up as Port Services Manager for Giacci Port Services. 
      This new initiative, for the Giacci Group, brought the Mine to Port relationship closer and provide seamless logistics and an accountability not experienced before. This modest start of 170,000 tonnes of cargo and Craig on his own, the business now handles in excess of 11 million tonnes with four operations staff.  Giacci Port Services now operates in two other states namely Darwin & South Australia. Craig is also well known to MMG and Karrara shipping (Part owner of Ansteel) having looked after their Geraldton shed management and shipping activities from 1996 until March, 2012. This growth of this shipping agency has solely been attributed to Craig’s customer service, attention to detail and above all a “can do “attitude. Of Craig’s 38 years’ experience in the shipping industry, all of this has been developed specifically in the Bunbury and Geraldton Ports with focus on handling bulk minerals and commodities.Over this time Craig had been dealing with reputable firms such as Iluka Resources (previously RGC & Westralian Sands), Sinosteel Midwest, Mount Gibson Iron Ore, Crosslands, Jabiru Metals & Oz Minerals to name a few. This involved carrying out all shipping requirements with a sound knowledge of export processes including cargo documentations, hold surveys and cargo sampling. After Giacci Port Services brought by Qube ports, Craig ventured out to form his own shipping and operations company, Batavia Shipping.   From this he has been contracted by Mount Gibson Mining, the biggest Iron Ore exporter in Geraldton, at the time, to manage and oversee the complete port and facility operation for both mine sites namely Tallering Peak and Extension Hill, at the port of Geraldton. Mount Gibson currently exports approx. 6mtpa from Geraldton.
      Since the company’s inception, Batavia Shipping has also attracted several other reputable companies to which the company provides outstanding customer service.Since Batavia Shipping has commenced, Craig believes the edge that his company has over its competitors is the experience, dedication and keenness to foster relationships with customers and demonstrate competency without complacency.
